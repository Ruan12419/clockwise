# Bidimensional List Project

## Introduction
This project is an exercise to practice my knowledge in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). It simulates changing direction in a bidimensional list.

## Features
- Changing direction based on the current position and the state of the bidimensional list.
- Inserting numbers into the bidimensional list.

## Applied OOP Principles
- Encapsulation
- Abstraction
- Polymorphism: The `DirectionStrategy` interface is implemented in several different ways.
